# LSTM-Classification-Model-for-Biosensor-Time-Series-Data

1. This code repo is for the project of time series data classification
2. Aiming to solve varies length input of time series input, capture local and global information using LSTM model
3. Also implement attention mechanism to assign attention score on the last hidden layer output of LSTM flow
4. The final R2 score is 0.88 on the validation dataset
